# TwitteRgpd

[üá´üá∑ French](README.fr.md)

TwitteRgpd is a script that displays a Twitter feed using the official widget, but asks the user for permission before loading anything. This makes it GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) friendly.

## Usage

1. Add a `div` element to your HTML page where you want the Twitter feed to appear.
2. Include the `twitteRgpd.js` script in your HTML page.
3. Call the `deploy` function with the `div` element and the desired configuration options.

Example:

```html
<div id="myTwitterFeed">Loading‚Ä¶</div>
<script src="twitteRgpd.js"></script>
<script>
twitteRgpd.deploy(document.getElementById('myTwitterFeed'), {
    account: 'OnlineCreation',
    width: 200,
    height: 150,
    theme: 'light',
});
</script>
```

In order to speed up the loading of your page, you are advised to include the `<script>` tags at the end of your HTML page, just before the closing `</body>` tag.

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available:

- account: the Twitter account to display.
- width: the width of the widget.
- height: the height of the widget.
- theme: the theme of the widget (light or dark).
- language: the language of the widget (if not set, the browser language will be used).
- translation: the translation of the widget (if not set, the default translation will be used).
- removeStylesheet: if true, the default stylesheet will not be injected (default: false).
- stylesheet: a stylesheet to inject (default: null).
- tweetLimit: the number of tweets to display (default: 0 = let Twitter decide).
- chrome: the chrome of the widget (default: null).
- forceReload: if true, the page will be reloaded when the user accepts the connection with Twitter (default: false). This is useful if you display several Twitter feeds on the same page.

You can find more information about the "chrome" option [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/timelines/overview).

            'direction': 'ltr',
            'title': 'Do you want to display our Twitter feed?',
            'message': 'A connection with Twitter will be made, this connection may share some of your personal data with Twitter.',
            'accept': 'Accept and display Twitter',
            'refuse': 'Refuse and hide Twitter',
            'refuseMessage': 'You have refused the loading of the Twitter widget. You can change your mind by clicking on the button below.',
            'acceptMessage': 'You have allowed the loading of the Twitter widget. You can change your mind by clicking on the button below.',
            'changeMind': 'Change your mind',
            'loading': 'Loading Twitter widget...',
            'blocked': 'The Twitter widget is blocked by your web browser. If you see an icon like this in your browser, click on it to unblock it.'
        }
    }
}
```

## Styling

The widget is displayed in a `div` element with the `twitteRgpd` class. You can style it as you wish. You may add a custom stylesheet to the `stylesheet` option. You also may use the `removeStylesheet` option to prevent the default stylesheet from being injected.

The following classes are also available:
-  `twitteRgpd-title`
-  `twitteRgpd-message`
-  `twitteRgpd-buttons`
-  `twitteRgpd-accept`
-  `twitteRgpd-refuse`
-  `twitteRgpd-changeMind`
-  `twitteRgpd-accepted`
-  `twitteRgpd-unload`
-  `twitteRgpd-unblock`
